# sequences

This repository was inspired by the ["Amazing Graphs"](https://www.numberphile.com/videos/amazing-graphs) Numberphiles video. The goal is to build some of the more interesting sequences from this video and the [On-Line Encycolpedia of Integer Sequences](http://oeisf.org/) with R.

## Currently built:
* [The Recam√°n sequence](https://oeis.org/A005132)
* [n-th prime minus its binary reversal](https://oeis.org/A265326)
* [Maximal product of any two numbers whose concatenation is n](https://oeis.org/A035930)
